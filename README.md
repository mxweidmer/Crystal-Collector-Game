## Description
### This is a simple guessing game.  The computer randomly picks a letter of the alphabet, and the player has 10 attempts to try and guess which letter was picked by typing keys on the keyboard.  The player can see on the screen all the letters they have attempted before.  If the player repeats a key, the input will be ignored and the player will continue with the same number of guesses left as before.  If the player guesses the correct key, the win tally goes up by one point.  If the number of attempts goes to zero, the player loses and the losses tally goes up by one.  A new random letter is selected each time the play either wins or loses.
