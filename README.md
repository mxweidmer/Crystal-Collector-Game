## Description
### This is a guessing game, where the computer generates a random number between 19 and 120. The player has 4 options in the form of crystals, each assigned a random value between 1 and 12. When a player clicks on one of the images, that value is added to their score. The goal of the game is to match the computer generated number by clicking on the different valued crystals. If the players score goes over the target number, they lose and a sound effect is played, as well as their losses counter increasing by one. Each time a player wins or loses the game is automatically reset with a new target number and new random values for the crystals.
